    "content": "# Territorial and Cultural Acknowledgement {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- ## First Nations Territories in BC The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), əl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations. There are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent. To learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/). Map Source --- ## Why Do an Acknowledgement? For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map. Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS. * A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding. --- ## What Does it Mean? What do we mean when we say **traditional**, **ancestral**, and **unceded territory**? It is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and coven the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. ### **Traditional** {: .no_toc } Recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied. The [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/), [əl̓ilwətaɁɬ](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/), and [Skwxwú7mesh-ulh](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/) Nations have traditionally occupied this area. ### **Ancestral** {: .no_toc } Recognizes territories and cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. One example is language, which has strong connections to ancestry. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of [Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/) and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak [Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/). ### **Unceded** {: .no_toc } Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were \"ceded\" by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The [RCMP](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/203-the-secret-life-of-canada/episode/15798131-s3-the-mounties-always-get-their-land-part-1) was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary.

These course policies are intended to establish a framework for navigating the course. {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- # Marking & Feedback Written answers and file submissions will be marked by your TA using a rubric. Assignments submitted by the due date will be graded and returned seven days after the due date. Short comments will be provided where applicable on written/file submissions and answer keys will be posted for the quizzes. If you want further feedback on you lab assignment ask your TA in lab or by email. ## Late Penalties {: .no_toc } Assessment submissions will be accepted without late penalty for seven days. Late assignments **waive their right** to prompt grading/feedback. Late assignments will be marked whenever is convenient for your TA (could be as late as the end of term). After the seven day grace period, **submissions will no longer be accepted**. # Accommodations My aim is to be flexible and accommodating. I can make accommodations for you on a case by case basis, but it is your responsibility to communicate your needs in a timely fashion (i.e. email before an assignment is due) Please contact the [Center for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) if you require accommodations for a disability. If you are registered please make me aware of any necessary accommodations by email in a timely manner. ## Absences {: .no_toc } If you are sick (with COVID or otherwise), please stay home to protect others and take care of yourself. Lectures will be available online and you may attend lab via zoom. ## Concessions {: .no_toc } If you require an [Academic Concession](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/degree-planning/academic-performance/academic-concession/) please email me promptly so that we can work together to figure out an accommodation for your situation. You are not obligated to explain your personal circumstances to me to justify the concession, my inent is to be accomodating. However, you must to communicate any need for a concession in a timely manner. If you require multiple concessions I may refer you to [Arts Advising](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/student-support/academic-support/academic-advising/). # Academic Integrity: The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. Plagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously. The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment. Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found [here](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-integrity/Links) Though you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information. # Strategies for Success * Be proactive * Timely communication is important! * Don't wait until the last minute to set up ArcGIS Pro, do it now to save yourself a headache down the road. * Drop by office hours * Attend Lectures * Ask Questions!

    "content": "# Final Projects {: .no_toc } 1. TOC {:toc} --- ## Learning Objectives By the end of this project you will be able to: * Formulate a Geographic Analysis Scenario * Identify geospatial datasets appropriate for the geographic analysis * Create a directory / geodatabase of datasets for the project (ensuring spatial and tabular data integrity) * Conduct GIS analyses that will demonstrate your knowledge of GIS analysis concepts and software tools * Visualize your results (maps) and workflow (model/flow chart) and discuss them in a brief report * Follow a project proposal to until the project is successfully completed * Build teamwork skills --- ## Deliverables The Project is due on the last day of term, **Wednesday June 22nd**. There is also a Final Project Proposal that is due **Tuesday June 14th**. The proposal will count as a 10% of your total Final Project grade. Deliverables for this project will consist of the following: * Project Proposal * Project Submission * A written report * Maps/charts visualizing your results * A flowchart visualizing your methodology --- ## Groups This is intended to be a group project. I suggest you work in a groups of 3. Groups larger than 4 are **not allowed**. If you are looking to join a group, try making a post to the **Final Project Group Search** discussion page on canvas, list any topics you might be interested in working on. If you are still having trouble finding a group try reaching out to your TA for assistance. I encourage you to work in groups, however I also recognize group work can be very difficult for some, especially those taking the course online. You may work alone if desired **but** you must request approval first. Choosing to work alone **will not** lower the expectations for your project. Your project will be evaluated using the same standards as group projects. --- ## Project Workflow ### Project Proposal: Explore Ideas and Acquire Data {: .no_toc } The proposal is intended to get you thinking about the project sooner rather than later, so you aren't stuck scrambling at the last minute. See the [Project Proposal](docs/Project_Proposal.md) page for details. The proposal is due **Tuesday June 14th** Download and format your data during this step. Review the datasets and determine which layers and associated attributes you will need for your study. Pay special attention to the format of the data, and to the projection information before starting your analysis. It is important to ensure you can access the desired data before starting your project! ### GIS Analysis {: .no_toc } The project should have a higher level of complexity than any of the four labs you completed during the course. Think about all the operations and tools that you have learned in the course, and apply these to your particular data and GIS analysis topic. A list of potential analysis operations includes: * Calculation of areas * Joining tables * Select by attribute/location: various queries * Field calculation * Buffers, dissolves, merges * Overlay tools: clip, erase, union, intersect * Raster overlay & reclassification * Working with DEMs (elevation, slope, aspect) It might be beneficial to do your project in Model Builder. You are not required to do so, but it could be helpful for storing your workflow, which will make it easier to remember/describe your methods. ### Flow Charts {: .no_toc } As you go through your GIS Analysis steps, document what you are doing and the specific operations you are performing (or use model builder!). You will produce a flow chart of your analysis and include it in the report. If you use model builder for your analysis, this can serve as the basis for your flowchart, but you should translate it into an easier to follow an more aesthetically pleasing format for the final submission. There are a number of ways to create flowcharts. You can draw them by hand, you can use power point, or you can try [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/). This site allows you to make aesthetically pleasing flowcharts quickly and easily, the video bellow gives you a quick overview of how to use the too. ### Data Visualization {: .no_toc } You will need to make a series of maps/charts (number and type(s) depends on the specific analysis) to visualize your methods and final results. These visualizations must follow the conventions of data classification and data display as learned in the course, and include all relevant map elements (legend, title, scale, north arrow, sources, insets/reference maps where necessary etc.) and take into consideration cartographic design principals (lecture in class on design). * Submit full resolution copies of each visualization (flowchart, maps, charts). These will be evaluated for aesthetic quality and effectiveness at conveying your findings. The full resolution copies are required just in case the embedded figures in your project report are not clear enough to read. ### Written Report {: .no_toc } Each group must produce a written report detailing their project. The report should contain the flowchart, maps, charts, and/or tables embedded in the document with in text references to the visualizations where applicable. The report should have the following sections: **Introduction** – What is the problem? Why should we care? Briefly introduce the scope of the issue you are addressing and conclude your introduction with your research statement. * **Research Statement** – What is/are the specific question(s) you are looking to address? **Data Sources** – What data are you using & where did they come from? What type of data are you working with (raster, vector, tabular)? What’s the scale & resolution, is these limiting factors? Are there any issues or special considerations with this data set? A table might be a useful way to help summarize this section concisely. **Methods** – What did you do? Why did you do it? Explain the analysis steps you took and justify the choices you made in your analysis. You can rely heavily on your flow charts for explaining the methods. You don’t need to detail every little step, be brief but throughout. * Don’t Say things like: “We doubled clicked the buffer tool and set Layer A as the input. We set the buffer distance to 1000 meters and clicked dissolve all. We set the output name as Layer B and hit run. Then we merged Layer B with Layer C naming it Layer D” * Instead Say: “We buffered Layer A by 1000 m because (justification). Then we merged it with Layer C” * **Flowchart** is best included here! **Results** – What does your analysis say? Describe the general patterns and trends that your analysis yielded. * Maps/charts go here! **Conclusions** – What are the overarching conclusions? Did you find what you expected? Did you answer the research statement? What are some potential future analysis that could result from this? **Bibliography** – Cite any data sources used. Also cite any relevant literature. It is not expected that you conduct a literature review, just make sure to cite any you do use. Reference them in a consistent format There is no word/page count. You can keep the report brief, just be thorough. Make sure you explain and discuss the key points. --- ## Project Rubric | Category | Details |Points |-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|**Analysis** |Considers the project holistically (GIS Analysis + Interpretation)Was the data projected correctly, were appropriate steps taken, are there missing steps, logical flaws, obvious errors?How thorough & rigourous was the analysisNeeds to be more than just a re-hash of a lab assignment|**60** |**Visualization** |Are the maps, charts, and diagrams effective and aesthecially pleasingDo they follow stylistic principals outlined in [lecture](https://june-skeeter.github.io/Module4_GEOS270/docs/Content_Part1.html) |**60** |**Report Content** |Does the report effectively convey the problem, explain the anaysis, discuss the results, and present conclusions/future researchDo they have each section as outlined on the proejct page |**60** |**Novelty & Relevance**|How unique/relevant is the topic/analysisDid groups come up with their own idea substantially build on one of the ideas presented |**30** |**Data & Bibliography**|Are the data sources approrpriate for the analysisDid they detail data sources and cite any sources used |**15** |**Proposlal** |Proposal is makred for completeness & effort (each section filled & project idea conveyed). |**25** |**Total Score** | ",

TOC {:toc} --- ## Using Geography Lab Computers This video gives an overview of some important steps when using the lab computers. Your browser does not support iframes. View Video in New Tab --- ## Initalize your H:/ Dirve **When you first logon to geography lab computers with your account** find C:\\Apps\\RunOnce.bat in the file manager. Double click on it to run it. This will initalize your account and set up access to your **H:/** drive. --- ## Work Locally, Save Remotely ### Work Locally {: .no_toc } During your lab, you should save your work to **C:\\temp**. This is a folder stored locally on the computer you are working on. Since it's the same machine you're working on, ArcGIS Pro can easily and quickly access and save files in this folder. * **Avoid** saving files to the Desktop or Documents folders and try to empty the Downloads folder frequently. These folders are all part of your user profile which travels to/from the server when you log in/off. The more data there is in the profile the longer it will take to log in/off. We had a student with 106GB on profile and it took 45 minutes to get in! ### Save Remotely {: .no_toc } The **C:\\temp** drive can accessed by multiple users. A single computer in room 115 might have 20-30 different students accessing it (in person + remotely) in a given week. Each time a new user logs on, the **C:/temp** folder is at risk for being overwritten. * It is **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** that you save your work elsewhere before you log off. When you sign up for your Geography lab account, you will be given server space known as your **H:/** drive folder; you should save your work here. To do so, follow these steps: **1**{: .label .label-red } Save your Map document and close ArcGIS Pro or any other software you may be using (Word, Excel, etc...) **2**{: .label .label-red } Launch My Computer, and navigate to **C:\\temp** **3**{: .label .label-red } Right click on your lab folder in **C:\\temp** and select **Copy** **4**{: .label .label-red } Navigate to **H:/** and **paste** your lab folder here ### Steps for Retrieving Work from H:/ {: .no_toc } When you come back next time to complete the assignment, you will transfer the files in the reverse direction. This is because the **H:/** drive is stored on a networked server, not the local machine. ArcGIS Pro will run slowly if you try to work directly from the **H:/** drive, which is why you **must transfer your files first**. To transfer your files: **1**{: .label .label-blue } Log in **2**{: .label .label-blue } Use My Computer to find **C:\\temp** and delete all the files you find there since they are likely not yours and you don't want to get mixed up. **3**{: .label .label-blue } Navigate to your **H:/** drive, select your current lab's folder , and copy it to **C:\\temp** **4**{: .label .label-blue } Resume your work ",

This is a proprietary program (costs money) that can be run on the Windows opperating system. You have two options for accessing the software: {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- ## Option 1: Geography Lab Computers All students will be given a UBC Geography logon, you should recieve logon credentials by email before the first day of lab. The Geography Department has two computer labs (rooms 115 and 237). Room 115 may be accessed in-person when the geography building is open; room 239 will be closed to in person access this summer due to construction. Both 115 and 239 can be accessed remotely (via remote desktop connection) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. To remotely access lab computers, follow [these instructions](RemoteDesktop.pdf). Information about the Geography Computer Labs can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/). **Note** the lab schedule and **refrain from remotely accessing a computer while other courses are holding lab session in that room**. * If you have not received logon credentials, contact Jose Aparicio at: labhelp@geog.ubc.ca * If your personal coputer is running Mac or Linux, it is **Strongly Recomened** you use this method to access ArcGIS Pro. * There is a lab fee to use geography computers: you must [pay the lab fee](http://geog-epayment.sites.olt.ubc.ca/fees/geoglab-fees/) by May 31st or you will loose access to your account. * **If you are having trouble logging on remotely** try: adding \"geoglab\\\" in front of your username. ## Option 2: Purchase a Student License You may purchase a student version of the software to install on your own computer for $30. ArcGIS Pro requires a PC (i.e. a computer running Windows) but if you have a Mac or Linux machine you can get around this by building a Windows partition on your hard drive or using a virtual machine. * If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you can [follow these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201468) to setup a partition. * **We cannot** provide any support for this step of the installation and it will probably just be easier for you to use Option 1 instead. **1**{: .label .label-red } Check that your computer meets the system requirements for ArcPro using [this link](http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/Client/Standard/?apikey=50F41142-39B0-4061-97C2-BA7B7FE43D0E&refid=1186&item=12433). **2**{: .label .label-red } Go [here](https://gis.ubc.ca/software/) to purchase, ArcGIS Pro. Fill out the info, make your pamment, and you should be given and ArcOnline Account and a link to download ArcGIS Pro. * If you run into any issues, contact Jose Aparicio at: labhelp@geog.ubc.ca ## Option 3: UBC Library GIS (Last Resort) This is not a viable solution for the whole semester as computer access is limited. However, if you are in a pinch, you can access the Koerner Library GIS Computers in person in room 217 or the computers in [room 218 remotely](https://remotelabs.ubc.ca/). These computers are not guranteed to be running most up to date version of ArcGIS Pro. ",

The final project and exam will both be worth 25% of your final grade. | Points Distribution | Percent of Points |---------------------|-------------------| Modules 1-6 | 50% | Final Project | 25% | Final Exam | 25% | --- ## Modules Each module is a lesson intended to introduce and cover specific topics within GIS, they will be published as individual webpages. They will be hyperlinked in the schedule above as they are posted. They will also be made accessible through Canvas and I will send a reminder email to the class each time a module is posted. Each module will have consist of three sections. ### Lecture Content {: .no_toc} Lecture content will consist of synchronous lectures, asynchronous video content, & course readings where applicable (there is no textbook, I'll provide .pdf files of any readings). Lectures will be in person in GEOG 101, Tuesday/Thursday from 12:00 - 14:00. Lectures will also be streamed [on zoom](https://ubc.zoom.us/j/68315782631?pwd=RFh0QmR1SzJ3cjhwYmlYSkZNbkcydz09) for those who cannot attend in person and recordings will be made available on canvas. * Synchronous lectures will cover the module content in depth and serve as your chance to ask questions and engage in discussion about the material. ### Lab Applications {: .no_toc} The labs will build on the lecture content and give you hands on practice working with GIS software. You can work through these in your lab section. See the [Lab Access](/Labs.md) page for more details on specifics. ### Assessment {: .no_toc} Each assessment will be due on the date listed in the [Course Schedule](#course-schedule). The assessments will cover both lecture and lab material and will be submitted via a canvas quiz. You will be allowed multiple attempts for quizzes in case you make a mistake or would like to update your answers, only your final submission will be marked. --- ## Final Exam The final exam will be completed asynchronously over Canvas. It will consist of a few essays, short answers, a flowchart question illustrating how to complete a GIS task, fill in the blanks, matching, multiple choice, and true false questions. The exam will cumulative and count for 25% of your final mark. * 24 Hour Window to Complete * 0:00 June 27th to 23:59 June 28th *(29th will an option if needed, but contact June to schedule)* * **One Attempt** - six hours * Not intended to take six hours. I just don't want you to feel rushed. * If you have a letter from access and diversity and need more than the allotted time, contact me **before** the exam. * Questions: *subject to adjustment* * Essays (~ 40%) * Flow chart question (~ 20%) * Create a flow chart outlining a GIS analysis * Short answer (~ 25%) * Mix of matching, fill in the blank, multiple choice, etc. (~ 15%) --- ## Final Project The project is a group assignment (2-4 members) that will account for 25% of your final grade. GIS is a collaborative discipline and your project should be done with a group unless special circumstances necessitate otherwise. You may only work on the project alone **only** if you get approval.

Incorporate different variables, look at different scales/resolutions/locations. Don't repeat the assignments, come up with ways **improve** upon the methods and do a deeper analysis. # Access to green space and bicycle infrastructure in Vancouver **Scenario**: Access to green space and bicycle infrastructure is important for quality of life in urban areas, promoting physical and mental health. Yet, green space and bike infrastructure are often inequitably distributed around cities. Explore the distribution of green space and bicycle infrastructure in Vancouver in relation to wealth, housing density, transit, etc. Check out the City of Vancouver Data Portal for data on parks, bicycle lanes, bike racks, trees, etc. that might be useful. It could also be helpful to incorporate some census data. Possible Analysis to consider * Geocoding (will be introduced in the coming weeks) * Select by location/attribute * Buffering to gauge accessibility * Intersections to count # bike racks, area of parks, length of bike lanes within census units # Possible Locations for a Ski Resort Define a boundary region and download a DEM & other necessary data. You can use google earth engine to download a DEM and get some other files from DataBc that might be important to consider (eg. Old Growth Forests) Possible Analysis to consider * Slope, Aspect, & Reclassify * Weighted Overlay or Raster Calculator * Proximity Analysis # Landslides in Burn Zones Forest fires are also some of the worst natural disasters impacting the province. Climate change and human activity are changing fire dynamics and leading to costlier fire seasons. After severe fires, intense precipitation events can trigger landslides. The burn severity data is available for 2015-2019 for BC. Select a Fire Center (I suggest not doing Coastal Fire Centre). Use DEM data (google earth) to calculate slope and combine with burn severity and precipitation (HectaresBC) to create landslide risk classification. Your selected Fire Center can serve as your boundary file for the DEM download. *This could also be adapted to look at logging instead of fires!* Possible Analysis to consider * Slope & Reclassify * Weighted Overlay or Raster Calculator * Proximity Analysis * Flow Analysis # Air Quality in BC Poor air quality is a significant health risk for vulnerable populations. Over recent years there have been serious smoke events impacting air quality province wide. Additionally, traffic and industrial activities exacerbate air quality issues in urban areas. Use this [air quality data](https://github.com/June-Skeeter/BCAirQuality) to look at how air quality changes across the region annually/seasonlally or investigate some specific event(s) eg. a bad fire season. Consider incorporating census data to see if there arae significant at risk populations (eg. youth and seniors) in places with air quality? Note - Look at the data coverage before you decide which scale to analyze census data at. Possible Analysis to consider * Import tabular (x,y) data * Calculating Fields * Inverse Distance Weighting * Zonal statistics * Tabular joins # Mapping Police Violence Use a dataset on [police violence](https://police-involved-deaths-ca.github.io/Data/) to map incidents of police violence in a specific region of your choice. You can choose a province (eg. Saskatchewan), or a specific city (eg. Toronto). Use census data to complement the analysis. If you choose this project, you can reach out directly to me for more information on the data and guidance how to approach the analysis. Possible Analysis to consider * Point in Polygon Analysis * Kernel Density * Linear Regression * Data Normalization & Classification ",

The proposal is intended to help you approach the project with a well rounded idea and provide clarity on the expectations for the project. Please use the proposal form here in [.pdf](Final-Project-Proposal-Form.pdf) or [.docx](Final-Project-Proposal-Form.docx). The form includes space for: * A brief description of the topic * The data sets that you will use * Confirmation that you are able to download them before submitting * Preliminary analysis plans Some things to think about when formulating your project proposal: * Is the project ambitious enough? Or is it overly ambitious? Would it be difficult to complete in the time remaining in the semester? * Your project **should not** be a repeat of one of the labs. If you want to revisit a lab and use it as inspiration, that is fine. But you should incorporate additional analysis and look at a different areas. * Make sure you have a clear understanding of how you are going to go from your data to your final deliverables. * Ensure that your data is available and easy to obtain in a usable format. The proposal is worth 25 pts, minor comments/suggestions will be provided where applicable. For detailed feedback, your group consider making time to meet with me either in person or over zoom during office hours (or by appointment) for further feedback. * Proposals turned in on time, will be promptly marked and returned the same day. * If you submit a proposal early, you can request it be marked early for quicker feedback. * The 7-day grace period applies to proposals like it does the module assignments. But be mindful late submissions **waive their right to prompt feedback**. ",

TOC {:toc} --- ## Learning Outcomes This course will expose you to key concepts and tools used to collect, map, and interpret geographic data. We will learn how geospatial data can be used to aid decision-making, complement scientific analysis, assist with urban planning, and help inform policy-making. You will gain practical experience using geospatial data to solve problems in both the natural and human realms. This term we will cover: * How GIS functions and how it can be applied to solve problems. * How phenomena are represented as geospatial data in a GIS. * How to implement geospatial analysis methods. * Visualizing geospatial data and principles of good map design. * Sources of error in GIS analysis and output. * The ethical implications of GIS analysis. * GIS workflows and collaborating to complete a GIS project. --- ## Course Schedule | Name | Topics |Post Date| Due Date |-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|[Module 1](https://june-skeeter.github.io/Module1_GEOS270/)|History of GIS, Coordinate Reference Systems Intro to ArcGIS Pro|TBD |TBD |[Module 2](https://june-skeeter.github.io/Module2_GEOS270/)|Data Types & Spatial Data Models |TBD |TBD |[Module 3](https://june-skeeter.github.io/Module3_GEOS270/)|Data Classification & Visualization |TBD |TBD |[Module 4](https://june-skeeter.github.io/Module4_GEOS270/)|Spatial Analysis & GIS Workflows Final Project Overview |TBD |TBD |[Module 5](https://june-skeeter.github.io/Module5_GEOS270/)|Spatial Analysis Cont., Sampling & Interpolation, Uncertainty |TBD |TBD |[Module 6](https://june-skeeter.github.io/Module6_GEOS270/)|GIS Applications & Research, Ethics, Exam Review |TBD |TBD |[Final Project](docs/Final_Project.md) |Proposal & Report |TBD |TBD |[Final Exam](docs/Overview.md/##final-exam) |Asynchronous on Canvas |TBD |TBD | --- ## Lecture Lectures are held Tuesday/Thrusday 12:30-14:00 in room 22 of the Geography building.
