    "content": "# Territorial and Cultural Acknowledgement {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- ## First Nations Territories in BC The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), əl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations. There are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent. To learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/). Map Source --- ## Why Do an Acknowledgement? For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map. Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS. * A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding. --- ## What Does it Mean? What do we mean when we say **traditional**, **ancestral**, and **unceded territory**? It is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and coven the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. ### **Traditional** {: .no_toc } Recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied. The [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/), [əl̓ilwətaɁɬ](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/), and [Skwxwú7mesh-ulh](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/) Nations have traditionally occupied this area. These nations are are part of a broader group known as the Coast Salish People. ### **Ancestral** {: .no_toc } Recognizes territories and cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. One example is language, which has strong connections to ancestry. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of [Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/) and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak [Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/). ### **Unceded** {: .no_toc } Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were \"ceded\" by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The [RCMP](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/203-the-secret-life-of-canada/episode/15798131-s3-the-mounties-always-get-their-land-part-1) was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary.

These course policies are intended to establish a framework for navigating the course. {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- # Feedback & Deadlines Module quizzes will be marked by your TA using a standard rubric. Short comments will be provided where applicable on written answers & map submissions. Submissions will be accepted without late penalty for seven days after their due date. * Quizzees submitted **by the due date** will be graded and returned within seven days after the due date. * If you want further feedback ask your TA in lab or by email. * Quizzees submitted **after the due date** waive their right to prompt grading/feedback. * Late assignments will not recieve written feedback and will be marked whenever is convenient for your TA * This could be as late as the end of term * After the seven day grace period, **submissions will no longer be accepted**. * **Do not** request an extension from your TA * The seven day grace period **does not** apply to the final project. * Late projects will be marked more harshly than on-time submissions # Accommodations I will make accommodations on a case by case basis for extenuating circumstances that prevent you completing course work. If you experience extenuating circumstances that require an accomodation please contact June by email ([june.skeeter@ubc.ca](june.skeeter@ubc.ca)). It is your responsibility to communicate your needs in a timely fashion (i.e. **before** a due date). * My typical approach is to give an alternative assignment or adjusting the weight of grades rather than giving extensions. Please contact the [Center for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) if you require accommodations for a disability. Once you are registered please make me aware of any necessary accommodations by email in a timely manner. ## Absences {: .no_toc } If you are sick (with COVID or otherwise), please stay home to protect others and take care of yourself. Lectures are streamed on zoom so that you may attend online. If you have to miss a lab session, you can attend an alternate session, just make sure to contact the TA running that session beforehand. ## Academic Concessions {: .no_toc } If you require an [Academic Concession](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/degree-planning/academic-performance/academic-concession/) please email me promptly so that we can work together to figure out an accommodation for your situation. You are not obligated to explain your personal circumstances to me to justify the concession, my inent is to be accomodating. However, you must to communicate any need for a concession in a timely manner. If you require multiple concessions I may refer you to [Arts Advising](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/student-support/academic-support/academic-advising/). # Academic Integrity: The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. Plagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously. The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment. Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found [here](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-integrity/Links) Though you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information. # Strategies for Success **Be proactive!** * Timely communication is important! If you have an issue, please bring it to my attention. * Drop by office hours & ask questions! * Don't wait until the last minute to set up ArcGIS Pro, do it now to save yourself a headache down the road.

TOC {:toc} --- ## Using Geography Lab Computers This video gives an overview of some important steps when using the lab computers. Your browser does not support iframes. View Video in New Tab --- ## Initalize your H:/ Dirve **When you first logon to geography lab computers with your account** find C:\\Apps\\RunOnce.bat in the file manager. Double click on it to run it. This will initalize your account and set up access to your **H:/** drive. --- ## Work Locally, Save Remotely ### Work Locally {: .no_toc } During your lab, you should save your work to **C:\\temp**. This is a folder stored locally on the computer you are working on. Since it's the same machine you're working on, ArcGIS Pro can easily and quickly access and save files in this folder. * **Avoid** saving files to the Desktop or Documents folders and try to empty the Downloads folder frequently. These folders are all part of your user profile which travels to/from the server when you log in/off. The more data there is in the profile the longer it will take to log in/off. We had a student with 106GB on profile and it took 45 minutes to get in! ### Save Remotely {: .no_toc } The **C:\\temp** drive can accessed by multiple users. A single computer in room 115 might have 20-30 different students accessing it (in person + remotely) in a given week. Each time a new user logs on, the **C:/temp** folder is at risk for being overwritten. * It is **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** that you save your work elsewhere before you log off. When you sign up for your Geography lab account, you will be given server space known as your **H:/** drive folder; you should save your work here. To do so, follow these steps: **1**{: .label .label-red } Save your Map document and close ArcGIS Pro or any other software you may be using (Word, Excel, etc...) **2**{: .label .label-red } Launch My Computer, and navigate to **C:\\temp** **3**{: .label .label-red } Right click on your lab folder in **C:\\temp** and select **Copy** **4**{: .label .label-red } Navigate to **H:/** and **paste** your lab folder here ### Steps for Retrieving Work from H:/ {: .no_toc } When you come back next time to complete the assignment, you will transfer the files in the reverse direction. This is because the **H:/** drive is stored on a networked server, not the local machine. ArcGIS Pro will run slowly if you try to work directly from the **H:/** drive, which is why you **must transfer your files first**. To transfer your files: **1**{: .label .label-blue } Log in **2**{: .label .label-blue } Use My Computer to find **C:\\temp** and delete all the files you find there since they are likely not yours and you don't want to get mixed up. **3**{: .label .label-blue } Navigate to your **H:/** drive, select your current lab's folder , and copy it to **C:\\temp** **4**{: .label .label-blue } Resume your work ",

TOC {:toc} --- ## Option 1: Geography Lab Computers All students will be given a UBC Geography logon, you should recieve logon credentials by email before the first day of lab. The Geography Department has two computer labs (rooms 115 and 237). They may be accessed in-person when the geography building is open and can be accessed remotely (via remote desktop connection) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. To remotely access lab computers, follow [these instructions](RemoteDesktop.pdf). Information about the Geography Computer Labs can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/). * **Note** the lab schedule and **refrain from remotely accessing a computer while other courses are holding lab session in that room**. * If you have not received logon credentials, contact Jose Aparicio at: [labhelp@geog.ubc.ca](labhelp@geog.ubc.ca) * If your personal coputer is running Mac or Linux, it is **strongly Recomened** you use this method to access ArcGIS Pro. * There is a lab fee to use geography computers: you must [pay the lab fee](http://geog-epayment.sites.olt.ubc.ca/fees/geoglab-fees/) by May 31st or you will loose access to your account. * **If you are having trouble logging on remotely** try: adding \"geoglab\\\" in front of your username. ## Option 2: Purchase a Student License You may purchase a student version of the software to install on your own computer for $30. ArcGIS Pro requires a PC (i.e. a computer running Windows) but if you have a Mac or Linux machine you can get around this by building a Windows partition on your hard drive or using a virtual machine. * If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you can [follow these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201468) to setup a partition. * **We cannot** provide any support for this step of the installation and it will probably just be easier for you to use Option 1 instead. **1**{: .label .label-red } Check that your computer meets the system requirements for ArcPro using [this link](http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/Client/Standard/?apikey=50F41142-39B0-4061-97C2-BA7B7FE43D0E&refid=1186&item=12433). **2**{: .label .label-red } Go [here](https://gis.ubc.ca/software/) to purchase, ArcGIS Pro.
