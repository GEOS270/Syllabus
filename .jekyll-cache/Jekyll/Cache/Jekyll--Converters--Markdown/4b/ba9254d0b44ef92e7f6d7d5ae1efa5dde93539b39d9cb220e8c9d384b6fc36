<h1 id="course-content">Course Content</h1>

<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>

<p>Lectures will cover the module content in depth and serve as your chance to ask questions and engage in discussion about the material.  Lectures are held each Tuesday/Thursday 12:30-14:00 in room 200 of the Geography building.  Lectures will also be streamed <a href="https://ubc.zoom.us/j/68713181849?pwd=SThIWUkvVTVtbkpwME11c1NDYlFVZz09">on zoom</a> and recordings will be made available on canvas the following day.</p>

<h3 class="no_toc" id="lecture-participation">Lecture Participation</h3>

<p>Lecture participation will be gauged using a platform called <a href="https://tophat.com/students/">TopHat</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The course <strong>Join Code</strong> is: <strong>605961</strong></li>
  <li>Questions (3-4) will be embedded in lecture presentations each day.
    <ul>
      <li>Questions can be answered via mobile device or laptop
        <ul>
          <li>Questions can <strong>only</strong> be answered during the lecture session</li>
          <li>They will be available to in person and remote attendees</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Questions will be marked based on participation (50%) and correctness (50%)
        <ul>
          <li>Anonymized answers will be reviewed and shared with the class to help gauge comprehension</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The participation participation will be incorporated into your <a href="Overview.md#evaluation">final grade</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lab-assignments">Lab Assignments</h2>

<p>Labs will build on the lecture and will primarily focus on GIS applications, giving you a chance to get hands on practice working with GIS software (ArcGIS Pro).  Some labs will also have associated videos or readings (there is no textbook, pdf files will be provided where applicable).  You can work through the labs in your lab section but they may also require some extra time outside of scheduled lab hours.</p>

<ul>
  <li>See the <a href="/Labs.md">Software and Computer Access</a> page for more details on how to access ArcGIS Pro.</li>
  <li>Labs will be formatted as open help sessions.  They are your chance to get one-on-one help from your TA and you may also use them to work collaboratively with your classmates (<strong>all answers/maps submitted must be your own work</strong>).
    <ul>
      <li>Lab attendance is not mandatory, but it is strongly encouraged.</li>
      <li>You <strong>must</strong> be registered for one of the following lab sections, which will meet once per week throughout the term in the Geography computer lab (room 115).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="no_toc" id="module-quizzes">Module Quizzes</h3>

<p>Each module’s Lab Assignment will have an associated quiz that will be due on the date listed in the <a href="#course-schedule">Course Schedule</a>.  The quiz will primarily pertain to the Lab Assignment, but will also build on concepts covered in lecture.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will be allowed multiple attempts for quizzes in case you make a mistake or would like to update your answers, only your final submission will be marked.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-project">Final Project</h2>

<p>The project is a group assignment (2-4 members) that will account for 25% of your final grade.  GIS is a collaborative discipline and your project should be done with a group unless special circumstances necessitate otherwise.  You may only work on the project alone <strong>only</strong> if you get approval.  I will introduce the project in depth later on in term, but if you’d like to plan ahead, you can find details on the <a href="https://geos270.github.io/FinalProject/">Final Proejct Page</a></p>

<h1 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h1>

<p>The final exam will be completed asynchronously over Canvas. It will consist of a few essays, short answers, a flowchart question illustrating how to complete a GIS task, fill in the blanks, matching, multiple choice, and true false questions.  The exam will cumulative and count for 20% of your final mark.</p>

<ul>
  <li>24 Hour Window to Complete
    <ul>
      <li>0:00 December 15th to 23:59 December 16th</li>
      <li><strong>One Attempt</strong> - six hours
        <ul>
          <li>Not intended to take six hours.  I just don’t want you to feel rushed.</li>
          <li>If you have a letter from access and diversity and need more than the allotted time, contact me <strong>before</strong> the exam.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1>

<p>At the end of term, your lowest scoring module quiz will be dropped.</p>
