<h1 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h1>

<p>I will make accommodations on a case by case basis for extenuating circumstances that prevent you completing course work.  If you experience extenuating circumstances that require an accomodation please contact June by email (<a href="june.skeeter@ubc.ca">june.skeeter@ubc.ca</a>).  It is your responsibility to communicate your needs in a timely fashion (i.e. <strong>before</strong> a due date).</p>

<ul>
  <li>My typical approach is to give an alternative assignment or adjusting the weight of grades rather than giving extensions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact the <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility">Center for Accessibility</a> if you require accommodations for a disability.  Once you are registered please make me aware of any necessary accommodations by email in a timely manner.</p>

<h2 class="no_toc" id="absences">Absences</h2>

<p>If you are sick (with COVID or otherwise), please stay home to protect others and take care of yourself.  Lectures are streamed on zoom so that you may attend online.  If you have to miss a lab session, you can attend an alternate session, just make sure to contact the TA running that session beforehand.</p>

<h2 class="no_toc" id="concessions">Concessions</h2>

<p>If you require an <a href="https://www.arts.ubc.ca/degree-planning/academic-performance/academic-concession/">Academic Concession</a> please email me promptly so that we can work together to figure out an accommodation for your situation.  You are not obligated to explain your personal circumstances to me to justify the concession, my inent is to be accomodating.  However, you must to communicate any need for a concession in a timely manner.  If you require multiple concessions I may refer you to <a href="https://www.arts.ubc.ca/student-support/academic-support/academic-advising/">Arts Advising</a>.</p>

<h1 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity:</h1>

<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.</p>

<p>Plagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously.  The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment.  Further incidents will be reported to the Presidentâ€™s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero.  A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the Universityâ€™s policies and procedures, may be found <a href="https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-integrity/Links">here</a></p>

<p>Though you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information.</p>
