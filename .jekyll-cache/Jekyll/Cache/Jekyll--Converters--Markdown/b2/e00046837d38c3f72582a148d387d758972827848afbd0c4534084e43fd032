<h2 id="option-2-purchase-a-student-license">Option 2: Purchase a Student License</h2>

<p>You may purchase a student version of the software to install on your own computer for $30. ArcGIS Pro requires a PC (i.e. a computer running Windows) but if you have a Mac or Linux machine you can get around this by building a Windows partition on your hard drive or using a virtual machine.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201468">follow these instructions</a> to setup a partition.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>We cannot</strong> provide any support for this step of the installation and it will probably just be easier for you to use Option 1 instead.</li>
    </ul>
