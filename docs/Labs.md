## Option 1: Geography Lab Computers

The Geography Department has two computer labs (rooms 115 and 237).  They may be accessed in-person when the geography building is open and can be accessed remotely (via remote desktop connection) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  All students will be given a UBC Geography logon, you should recieve logon credentials by email before the first day of lab.

* There is a lab fee to use geography computers: you must [pay the lab fee](http://geog-epayment.sites.olt.ubc.ca/fees/geoglab-fees/) or you will loose access to your account.  

* If you have not received logon credentials, contact Jose Aparicio at: [labhelp@geog.ubc.ca](labhelp@geog.ubc.ca) 

* If your personal coputer is running Mac or Linux, it is **strongly Recomened** you use this method to access ArcGIS Pro.

To remotely access lab computers, follow [these instructions](RemoteDesktop.pdf).  Information about the Geography Computer Labs can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/).  

* **Note** the lab schedule and **refrain from remotely accessing a computer while other courses are holding lab session in that room**.

* **If you are having trouble logging on remotely** try: adding "geoglab\" in front of your username.

## Option 2: Purchase a Student License

You may purchase a student version of the software to install on your own computer for $20. ArcGIS Pro requires a PC (i.e. a computer running Windows) but if you have a Mac or Linux machine you can get around this by building a Windows partition on your hard drive or using a virtual machine.

* If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you can [follow these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201468) to setup a partition.
  * **We cannot** provide any support for this step of the installation and it will probably just be easier for you to use Option 1 instead.
  * **Note**: newer versions of MacOS do not support partitioning
